% 
%  The code has been developed by Ehsan K. to answer 
%  the assignment 5, and is available in this file: ehsan20.HW05.pl
%  
%  1) All the requested features are covered.
%     - If the answer is positive, the returned answer would be formatted and returned
%     - If the answer is negative or it does not comply with what is available in the database,
%       then the query would be failed. In this case we first make sure that the minimum grammatical 
%       rules are met in the given query.
%     - If the grammar of the query is wrong, then a proper message is returned and the query would 
%       not be further evaluated against the database.
%  1.5) It understands the difference between, an actor, and an actress.
%  2) Extra features are provided for extra points.
%     - User can ask about the release year of a movie
%     - The release year can be also added to the end of each sentence
%     - User can also ask about the relative release time of movies
%  3) For example of how to query for the extra features, see the end of this transcript (ehsan20.HW05.txt).
