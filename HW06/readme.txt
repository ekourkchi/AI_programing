        (+10) Compares LISP and Prolog
        Part of the reason for not using Python in this class is because it is already covered in ICS 215; ICS 313 uses LISP as an example of functional programming languages and Prolog as a logical language, and ICS 361 is designed to be an alternative to ICS 313 with a more practical focus on AI rather than emphasizing the programming languages themselves
        As for what differentiates LISP from the other languages:
            Working with lists is much more direct in LISP (no need to import java.util.List)
            The language itself is designed to be easily modifiable through the REPL (instead of having to recompile after every change, you can just write the modifications directly into the REPL; also see the last three or four paragraphs here)
            Macros are very convenient in LISP; this is something that would be covered more heavily in ICS 313
        Even if you do not write another line of LISP in your life, you did just learn the basics of a programming language in about two months; if you pursue a career in industry, you will at least have to quickly learn how to use the domain-specific libraries at your workplace if not some entirely new languages

Final Score: 100/90
